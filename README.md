source ./DeepMiRTss_env/bin/activate
cd ./DeepMiRTss_env
```
Third, download the software package.  
```
git clone https://github.com/jwanglabwangzhi/DeepMiRTss

```
Fouth, cd to the package directory,run requirements and setup.py script to install.
```
cd ./DeepMiRTss
pip install -r requirements.txt
python setup.py install
```
Fifth, download the genomic data and DanQ model data and put it into the pre_load folder.

hg19:[http://mcube.nju.edu.cn/jwang/member/wangzhi/hg19.7z](http://mcube.nju.edu.cn/jwang/member/wangzhi/hg19.7z) unzip it as hg19.fa  
DanQ model:[http://mcube.nju.edu.cn/jwang/member/wangzhi/DanQ_bestmodel.hdf5](http://mcube.nju.edu.cn/jwang/member/wangzhi/DanQ_bestmodel.hdf5)

## USAGE
The following 3 commands were provided by the DeepMiRTss package:  
1 TssFinder, 2 StatAnalysis, 3 RegView.
### 1. TssFinder  
This command is used to compute the miRNA TSSs according to ChIP-seq data or 5' end of cap-protected RNA-seq data.  
All data should be generated by peak-calling to generate peak files and the peak file must use the first six columns of  
the BED format as input. The BED format can be found at [UCSC geonome browser website](http://genome.ucsc.edu/FAQ/FAQformat#format1)
#### Parameters:  
<-h --help>  
<-p --peak_filename> [The signal  peak file]    
A signal file is a necessity for the whole calculation process. You can use different kinds of  peak calling tools to obtain the signal file.  
<-k --judgement_filename> [The signal file for judgement]  
Another signal file can help to improve the accuracy of prediction . It is optional.  
<-e --expressed_filename> [miRNA expression file]  
We suggest providing no more than 50 miRNAs at a time which reduces the waiting time.  
<-n --number_alternative_tss>[number of alternative TSSs]    
The predicted number of alternative TSSs, and the default value is 3, you can set any positive number to obtain multiple results for the same miRNA.
#### Examples：
```
# When you have two signal files and express file, code like this help you find TSSs based on expression file.
TssFinder -p ./example/pol2.bed -k ./example/h3k4me3.bed -e ./example/express.txt
```
#### Results：
You can get a table for TSSs with the basic information and score.

### 2. StatAnalysis  
Make full use of DanQ model to calculate and analyze sequence features of region nearby TSSs.The DanQ model can refer to [``DanQ: a hybrid convolutional and recurrent neural network for predicting the function of DNA sequences''](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/nar/gkw226)
#### Parameters:  
<-h --help>  
<-u --upstream> [The distance value]  
The distance value between TSS and analysis region,and the default value is 0. You can choose the TSS region (TSS-500, TSS+500) as the analysis region which is the default or choose other region as you like.  
<-d --DanQ> The parameter helps the module predict binding TFs by DanQ model.  
<-j --Jarspar> The parameter helps the module find bnding TFs by Jarspar Database TFBSTools. Please make sure install Jaspar TFBSTools correctly.  
#### Examples：
```
# If you analysis TSSs region (TSS-500,  TSS+500) with DanQ model, you can run like follow.
StatAnalysis -d
```
#### Results：
You can get a table for TSSs with the basic information and score.

### 3. RegView  
We use JavaScript and Ajax to dynamically visualize the features of miRNA alternative TSSs. So you can find the feature value and compare different alternative TSSs at the same time.  
#### Parameters:
<-t --top> [The number of TFs to display ranking according to TF binding value]
#### Examples：
```
RegView -t 10
```
#### Results：
You can get a web page to visulize the results like the page [here](http://mcube.nju.edu.cn/jwang/lab/soft/deepmirtss_example/visulization.html).

## FAQ  
1 ChIP-seq siganl data includes pol2, DHS, and the transcription related histone such as h3k4me3, h3k4me2, etc.  
2 The basic idea of peak calling of 5' end of cap-protected RNAs data including CAGE, TSS-Seq, START-seq, CAP-seq, 5'RNA-Seq, 5'GRO-Seq etc is to identify regions with a high density of 5 end RNA sequencing reads.  
3 Any file generated by different peak-calling tools can be used as input, as long as the first six columns of the bed format are satisfied.  
4 Of course, you can use any peak-calling software, but we recommend using MACS2 to call peaks for ChIP-seq data and peak-calling for 5' end of cap-protected RNAs data with HOMER.  
5 If you don't provide -e parameter as a express file in 'TssFinder' command, the program will compute all miRNA which might last for a long time. So we suggest providing no more than 50 miRNAs at a time which reduces the waiting time.  
6 The command 'StatAnalysis' must be based on the result of command 'TssFinder' which generates a 'miRNA_alternative_tss.bed' file.  
7 The command 'RegView' must be based on the result of command 'StatAnalysis' which generates a 'y.csv' file.
